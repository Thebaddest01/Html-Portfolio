<h1>The Best Movies According To Sam</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Troy</h3>
<p>Really interesting story and the action is epic.</p>
<h3>Fast and Furious</h3>
<p>In general all Fast and Furious movies are really good. So, I can't really choose a particular movie out of the series.</p>
<h3>The Bigger They Are The Harder They Fall</h3>
<p>Lately after playing Red Dead Redemption 2, cowboy movies have become my thing. 
    So, with Idris Elba acting this movie and the story and action being extremely epic, 
    this movie instantly jumped to my top three best movies.</p>
